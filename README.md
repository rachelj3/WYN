Welcome to WYN! 
Course: CPTS 489
Group: Ethan Nelson, Kate Brickner, Rachel Jones

WYN is a project created for CPTS 489 at Washington State University. It aims to create an e-commerce site that provides users with local services near them.

Get ready to run WYN! Here are some steps to make for a smooth run: 
1. Download all code and open parent folder in VSCode
2. Make sure all components are downloaded
    Components:
    - Node.js
    - Express
    - Sequelize
    - SQLite3
    - bcrypt (for password hashing)
    - express-session (for user sessions)
    - nodemon (to run in localhost:3000)

3. If you run into any issues with node_modules, try running npm install again to fix dependencies. If you still have problems, remove the node_modules and the package-lock.json and reinstall the dependencies. Everything in package.json should handle that reinstallation. 
4. Please let us know if any problems occur! All three group members are able to run this program and we all can help troubleshoot or provide a live demo to aid in presentation of our live product
5. To start up the program, run nodemon in your terminal and go to localhost:3000 in your browser!
